# Little Lemon Restaurant App  
This is the capstone project of the Meta iOS Developer Professional Certification.  

## Problem Statement  
Little Lemon Restaurant has discovered that their customers are frustrated because they can't easily order food online. This limitation makes it difficult for the restaurant to plan staff and food supplies efficiently, as they rely solely on in-restaurant customers. To address this, the app provides an online ordering system that enhances customer convenience and improves restaurant operations.  

## Project Overview  
This app is designed to provide a seamless food ordering experience, allowing users to browse, filter, and sort menu items while also supporting offline access. I've utilised the provided wireframes and initial pages as a foundation to develop my own version of the app.

## Features Implemented  
- **Onboarding Flow**: Enables users to create accounts and manage authentication.  
- **Navigation Setup**: Structured the app's navigation for a smooth user experience.  
- **Data Fetching & Storage**: Integrated an API to fetch restaurant data and implemented **Core Data** for offline access.  
- **Sorting & Filtering**: Added sorting and filtering functionalities for food items to enhance usability.  
- **Online Ordering System**: Allows customers to place orders through the app, helping the restaurant manage demand and resources efficiently.
